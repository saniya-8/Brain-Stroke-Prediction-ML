# 🧠 Brain Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses supervised machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a brain stroke based on patient health parameters. The model is trained on a publicly available Kaggle dataset and implemented using Python and Scikit-learn.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Brain Stroke Dataset
- Provider: Jillani Softtech
- The dataset is downloaded dynamically using KaggleHub.

⚠️ Dataset is not uploaded to GitHub to follow best practices.
